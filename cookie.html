                <p>ZEEKR EU B.V. (also referred to as "ZEEKR", "we" or "us"), uses cookies on the ZEEKR Platforms. A
                    cookie is a small text document, which often includes a unique identifier. Cookies are created when
                    your browser loads a particular website. The website sends information to the browser which then
                    creates a text file. Every time the user goes back to the same website, the browser retrieves and
                    sends this file to the website's server. Find out more about the use of cookies on <a class="blue"

                    which serve a similar purpose to cookies and which allow us to monitor and improve our ZEEKR
                    Platforms and email communications. When we talk about cookies in this Cookie Policy, this term
                    includes these similar technologies. If you would like more information about our privacy practices,
